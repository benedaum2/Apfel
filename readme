APFEL: analysis of Anisotropic Plasticity by Finite ELements
parts of this software are based on SOOFEAM (http://www.soofea.org/)

Usage Instructions:
change to the directory Apfel/, then run the following commands
in the Matlab command shell:

1. set_env()
   makes the folder structure known to matlab

2. a = apfel('examples/collapse_quad_coarse.xml')
   this starts the simulation of the predefined xml-input file 
   'collapse_quad_coarse.xml'. The simulation takes about 2 mins.
    
   The model contains a very coarsely meshed 2d half-model of a 
   symmetric beam loaded at the symmetry plane.
   A detailed describtion of this particular problem is provided 
   (in german) in chapter 12 of my master's thesis, see p. 53 in 
   Diplomarbeit_Daum.pdf.
	 
   Feel free to try the other input examples,
   however, the postprocessing routine is preconfigured for the
   beam example.

3. frame = post(a, 5)
   Display the results by the integrated 2d postprocessing routine. 
   (For 3d problems the open source programm GiD can be used)
   postprocessing takes about 15 secs.

   The undeformed configuration is shown in blue and the deformed 
   configuration in red. The deformation is scaled by a factor of 100.

   In the output, nodes are displayed as circles and Integration points
   as rhomboids. Filled rhomboides indicate yielding in the respective 
   integration point. the elastic elements are fully integrated and extra
   integration points were added to the yielding elements. The used 
   elements are of the Lagrange class with a center node.

   BCs are indicated by triangles at the nodal position,
   red for displacement Bcs and blue for force BCs. The orientation of
   the triangle indicates the orientation of the BC.
