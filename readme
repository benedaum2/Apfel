APFEL: analysis of Anisotropic Plasticity by Finite ELements
parts of this software are based on SOOFEAM (http://www.soofea.org/)

Usage Instructions:
change to the directory Apfel/, then run the following commands
in the Matlab command shell:

1. set_env()
   makes the folder structure known to matlab

2. a = apfel('examples/cantilever_lin_quad_lag23.xml')
   this starts starts the simulation of the predefined xml-input file 
   'cantilever_lin_quad_lag23.xml'. A describtion of this particular 
   problem is provided (in german) in chapter 12 of my master's thesis,
   see p. 53 in Diplomarbeit_Daum.pdf.
	 
   Feel free to try the other input examples,
   however, the postprocessing routine is preconfigured for the
   cantilever example.

3. frame = post(a, 40)
   Display the results by the integrated 2d postprocessing routine. 
   For 3d problems the open source programm GiD can be used

   for the example 'cantilever_lin_quad_lag23.xml'
   the result should look like ./figures/collapse_quad-2010-05-14_3x4-crop.pdf
